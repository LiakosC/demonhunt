Platform game prototype for learning purposes.

Some images and audio are taken from Blizzard (Warcraft 3).

Game features:
- Multi-room teleportation / physics system.
- Map generation system.
- Riddle solving.
- Combat.

No tools, plugins, special editors or frameworks. Made in Nodepad++ and vanilla Javascript back in my junior days.

To complete this game, you must collect everything. But finding the special artifact is nearly impossible. Press [Enter] and speak the word.

Created with PhaserJS2 and much love.
